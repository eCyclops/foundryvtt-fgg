## Known Issues
- The character creation dialogue box does not close for some reason (help would be appreciated in finding the errant code)
- 'Magic-User' default class for spells (I can't find the preset for this to make it FGG appropriate)

## To-Do List
- Add the appropriate modifiers for all the attributes (currently using OSE modifiers)
- Try to work out a way to add size category damage (S/M L)
- Validate monster saves as per FGG
- Modify preset abilities (open doors, bend bars etc. to FGG)
- Modify armour categories to FGG
- Consider weapon speed (this might be optimistic for my skills)
- Validate encumbrance  and speed with FGG
